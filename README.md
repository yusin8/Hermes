# Hermes Agent Control Room

A public template for setting up an **Agent Control Room** first, then scaling from one Hermes agent to direct specialists, orchestrated teams, and automated workflows.

The Agent Control Room is a sidecar repo/folder that documents and governs your Hermes agents. It is not an agent itself. It is the system map, operating manual, registry, and recovery notebook for the agents you run.

## Positioning

```text
Create or choose a VPS.
Bootstrap the Agent Control Room.
Register one Hermes agent.
Add direct specialists when roles become clear.
Add an orchestrator when you want one front door.
Automate only after the manual system works.
```

## Mental Model

```text
Agent Control Room = side control plane
Orchestrator       = optional manager/front-door agent
Specialists        = focused Hermes agents with role-specific tools
Task Bus           = handoff desk between orchestrator and specialists
You                = owner/operator with direct access to everything
```

## Architecture Levels

### Level 1: Agent Control Room + One Agent

Set up the control room and register one Hermes agent.

Best for:

- One personal Hermes agent
- VPS setup documentation
- Docker migration planning
- Keeping runbooks and secret maps organized

### Level 2: Direct Specialist Agents

Add multiple role-specific Hermes agents and talk to them directly.

Examples:

- `hermes-life`
- `hermes-seo`
- `hermes-dev`
- `hermes-cmo`
- `hermes-ops`

### Level 3: Orchestrator + Specialists

Add `hermes-orchestrator` as an optional front door. You can still talk directly to specialists, but the orchestrator can route and synthesize work.

### Level 4: Automated Agent Team

Add recurring workflows, audits, backup checks, task routing, result review, and optional direct gateway/API calls.

```

## Quick Start

1. Create or choose an Ubuntu/Debian VPS.
2. Clone this repo onto the VPS, usually at `/root/agent-control-room`.
3. Link or install the bundled skills into your agent tool.
4. Copy `templates/agent/` into `agents/<your-agent-name>/`.
5. Fill in `inventory.md`, `docker.md`, `env-map.md`, `runbook.md`, and `backup.md`.
6. Keep raw secrets out of the control room.
7. Store live Hermes data in `/srv/<agent-name>/data` or your preferred runtime path.
8. Add specialist agents only when roles become clear.
9. Add an orchestrator only when direct specialist usage becomes annoying.

See `docs/starter-guide.md` for the recommended VPS bootstrap flow.

## Security Rule

Never commit raw secrets.

The control room may record:

- secret names
- provider
- scope
- location
- rotation date

It must not record:

- API key values
- OAuth refresh tokens
- passwords
- private keys
